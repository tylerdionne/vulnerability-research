## Ret2csu:   
Uses two gadgets in the `__lib_csu_init()` function (in binaries compiled on a GLIBC prior to 2.34) to set the arguments for a syscall. In this case, set the arguments to a `read()` syscall in gadget #1, write `/bin/sh\0` to memory and then make a call to `system(rdi=writeable_mem)`.
