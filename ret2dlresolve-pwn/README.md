## Ret2dlresolve  
Manipulates the dynamic linker’s symbol resolution process by crafting fake entries in dynamic linking structures (jmprel, symtab, strtab) to ultimately create a fake reloc argument, push it on to the stack and call plt init. In this case, wrote "system\0\0" to a fake strtab, created a fake Elf64_Sym entry pointing to this string, and a fake Elf64_Rel entry pointing to the symbol and given that rdi was set to ‘/bin/sh\0’ prior to resolution, once init plt was called with the fake reloc arg a shell was spawned.
