## Srop (Sigreturn Oriented Programming):  
Manipulates the kernel’s signal handling mechanism by crafting fake signal frames and triggering sigreturn syscalls. In this case, the first stage consists of crafting a fake signal frame for a read() syscall, triggering a sigreturn syscall and pushing our fake frame onto the stack thus executing a read() syscall where the data is stored at our fake stack in writable memory. The second stage consists of crafting a fake signal frame for an execve() syscall, sending a ‘/bin/sh’ read by the read() syscall in the first stage and stored at our fake stack, triggering a sigreturn syscall and pushing our fake frame onto the stack thus executing an execve() syscall with ‘/bin/sh’.
